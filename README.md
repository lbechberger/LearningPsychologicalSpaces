The code in this repository explores learning a mapping from images to psychological similarity spaces with neural networks. 

The research based on the code in this repository has been submitted to [AIC 2018](http://aic2018.pa.icar.cnr.it/):

## About

Our scripts use TensorFlow 1.4.1 with Python 3.5 along with scikit-learn. You can find scripts for setting up a virtual environment with anaconda in the [Utilities](https://github.com/lbechberger/Utilities) project. **Please note that all python scripts have to be executed from the directory in which they reside in order to work properly.**

The folder `NOUN` contains a first feasibility study on the NOUN database (presented at AIC 2018), conducted by Lucas Bechberger and Elektra Kypridemou.
The folder `Shapes` contains a follow-up study on a data set of shapes (work in progress), conducted by Lucas Bechberger and Margit Scheibel.

Additional `README.md` files in those folders give more detail about the respective project and its scripts.
